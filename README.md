# Canvas Drag selector

This is a plugin for the HTML5 Canvas element. It is currently planned to be used alongside [d3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3), to allow for clicking and dragging to select elements on a canvas. This is a Canvas equivalent of the SVG drag selector found [here](https://github.com/lmcnulty4/CanvasDragSelector).

This is planned to have a very similar API to its SVG equivalent, and is still currently a work in progress.
